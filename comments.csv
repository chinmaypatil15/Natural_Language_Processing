"I notice there are 56 videos in the Complete Python Playlist.  Do i focus on videos in 12 days. Which videos i need to focus on for the learning python, flask and django"
Thank you for creating such a vast amount of great quality content!
I just happen to come across your videos here and this has been eye opening. I have been learning for over six month but seems not to be getting my direction yet. I would ensure I watch the playlist. Thanks for your effort.
Bro have no laptop but i interested to learn python programing is there any posible to learn in my mobile but some time when ever i buy laptop is there possible
Entire 148 videos also v have to refer for data science or is their any limit pls me know.. i am confused üòï
If you are a beginner in coding and transiting to machine learning plz don&#39;t start with Machine learning instead of it start with full stack web dev  and then data structure &amp; algorithm  do some projects of web dev (start to finish) try competitive programming along side and then go to machine learning... plz listen to my advice it will save lot of your effort...i started with learning python then Directly to ML seriously guys its lead me nowhere....plz don&#39;t do what i did...
how can i join to this channel?
best motivation ever
